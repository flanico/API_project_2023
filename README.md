# API_project_2023
Final project of Algorithms and Data Structured - Politecnico di Milano 2023

## Assignment
This individual project aims to apply the techniques learned during the 'Algorithms and Principles of Computer Science' course, with particular emphasis on code efficiency. The implementation of a solution to a problem is required using the C programming language (C11 standard), without the use of external libraries or multithreading.

The solution was evaluated with a score of 30/30, awarded through automated tests based on memory usage and computation time.
